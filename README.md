# **Machine Learning Classification Experiments**

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that explore and compare different classification algorithms in machine learning.<br>
We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the following classification algorithms:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. Naive Bayes

## Project Overview

In this project, we aimed to assess the effectiveness and suitability of various classification algorithms for a specific dataset/task. Each algorithm was implemented and evaluated individually, and their results were compared to determine which one performs best.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `knn_classification`
- `decision_tree_classification`
- `random_forest_classification`
- `svm_classification`
- `naive_bayes_classification`

## How to Use

You can access each algorithm's implementation and results by navigating to the respective Jupyter Notebook. In each notebook,
